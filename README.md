# c_programming

my C files

// All these code is an adaptation to the 

// Caleb Curry C course (that course taught me a lot) 

// I prefer to code using GNU/Linux

// You can use Emacs or Vim to study these code

// Generally I tend to avoid vsCode (code)

// But, do whatever you want...

/* There is codeBlocks which is an opensource editor and can be installed in M$ as well */

// Variables

// int x = 20;

// int is a integer type; "x" is the variable name; "=" is an attribution sign (it is not a equal sign); 20 is the variable value

// this is an expression that declares and initialise the "x" variable

// int y = x / 2;

// "y = x / 2" is an expression that evaluates (resumes/calculates) to a single value

// printf("%i\n", 123)

// "%i" is a placeholder to an integer

// printf("%i\n", y)

// "%i" is a placeholder to an integer

// printf("The magic number is: %i\n", y);

// printf("The magic number is: %i\n The value of x is %i\n", y, x);

// two integers placeholders

// int x = 10;

// this expression is called hard coding

// Comments

// Single line comment (can go before the code in a single line or after the code)

/* Multi-line 
code can go before the code. e.g.: in the heading of a code or after
the code  */

/* You can put marks on your code as well to visit them later. Like
so: 

// TODO

// fixIT
